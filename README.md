1.This KNIME workflow analyzes the Iris dataset (150 rows, 6 columns) by:  
  1.Reading CSV data (sepal/petal length & width, species).  
  2.Checking for missing values.  
  3.Performing statistical analysis.  
  4.Visualizing data using bar charts and scatter plots.
  The goal is to explore relationships between flower characteristics efficiently.

2.This KNIME workflow reads a CSV file and performs statistical analysis on the dataset. The Statistics node calculates key metrics such as min, max, mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis for each column. The results help in understanding data distribution and detecting anomalies. The workflow also includes scatter plots and bar charts for data visualization.
